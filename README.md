## General Computer Science Work (C and Python):

### Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science:

Harvard's CS50 course, which I took on EDx, provided me an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.


Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML.


This Github Repository contains the projects I worked on. I only showcase the most notable project in each week, but more are available in respective folders. Additionally, the full course syllabus can be found here: https://docs.cs50.net/2017/x/syllabus.html
